# MyEmployeeAdderApp

This is going to be my first big desktop application using c#
The idea is to create a desktop app - add new employees - names- phone numbers (formatted) and save it in to a txt file. 
Add new employee button , sort by ABC button. 
Using dynamic array to increment the number of employees real time , so you dont need to declare a specific number. 
Write and read the items to/from a file so the app saves all the data after a crash or just after click on the x button or close.
